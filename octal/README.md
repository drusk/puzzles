From http://problemotd.com/problem/octal/

To honor the first day of October we'll be building a converter from octal 
to decimal. Your converter must have some sort of validation. For instance, 
39 is not a valid octal number where as 31 is. If your function takes in 31 
it should output 25.

The solution is implemented in Ruby in octal.rb.
